2. Attribute That Improved User Experience Most:
required

It ensures users fill important form fields before submission.

QUESTION 4: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
1.
Planning the Structure

Challenge:

Remembering element nesting

Solution: consistent indentation and validation

QUESTION 5: GIT & GITHUB IMPLEMENTATION
1.
Git Commands Used
